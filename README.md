# LENA App
### This is an AR Project using RealityKit.
Followed course from [Reality School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzqdw8gfzQ&list=PLBv1NzmBcY51F-pdOIywpndccaB21NTid&index=1) on youtube.

### The hardware that was used to create this app:

- iPhone 6s (running iOS -v 15.0.2

## IDE

```
I used the latest version of this code *-v 2.2.4*

## About 3D Objects
When choosing a 3D object, Swift works with .usdz file format. Try and also choose PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) format, these objects have a more realistic look to them.

### The 3D assets should meet these requirements if possible
- USDZ Format
- PBR Materials/Textures
- PBR Metal/Roughness Workflow

### View the 3D Assets
- Finder
- Xcode 3D Assets Viewer (built in xcode)
- Reality Converter
- PhotoShop (to remove background and create .PNG thumbnails)
